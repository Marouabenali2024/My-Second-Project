        <strong>Caprese Salad</strong>

        <p>
          Fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil drizzled with balsamic glaze.
        </p>
      </li>
       <li> <strong> Burrata Mushroom Bites</strong>
        <p>
          These cheesy bites over whole-wheat pita rounds make for a light and
          fresh appetizer. Do your best to choose large, uniformly sized
          mushrooms to ensure you can pack an equal amount of the cheesy filling
          into each.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li> <strong> Gooey Mac & Cheese Balls</strong>
      <p> Mozzarella, Swiss, Monterey Jack and Parmesan cheeses combine to create the most indulgent-tasting mac & cheese balls you’ve ever tried.</p></li>

        <strong>Teriyaki Chicken Fried Rice</strong>

        <p>
        Fried rice is a great dish to make for weeknight dinners. Try a few of my other fried rice recipes: Korean Gochujang Fried Rice, Kimchi Fried Rice, Thai Fried Rice, Chinese Vegetable Fried Rice, and Egg Fried Rice.

        <strong>Chocolate Fondue</strong>

        <p>
          Assorted fruits and marshmallows served with rich chocolate fondue.

       </li>
        <strong>Pastries</strong>

        <p>
          Pastries include pies, cobblers, and anything else made with a light and flaky bread crust. They’re often filled with fruit, chocolate, nuts, or spices to elevate the flavor profile of the treat. Apple pie is the quintessential American pastry.
        </p>
      </li>
       <li>
        <strong>Cookies</strong>

        <p>
          Made from flour and sugar, cookies are usually small, flat, and round. To create sandwich cookies, just place a small amount of jam or icing in the middle of two cookies. Cookies can also be cut in elaborate shapes, perfect for different seasons and events.
